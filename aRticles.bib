During the fermentation of kombucha, consisting of mainly acidic compounds, microorganisms, and a tiny amount of alcohol, a biofilm called SCOBY forms. The bacteria in kombucha has been generally identified as Acetobacteraceae. Kombucha is a noteworthy source of B complex vitamins, polyphenols, and organic acids (mainly acetic acid). Nowadays, kombucha is tended to be prepared with some other plant species, which, therefore, lead to variations in its composition. Pre-clinical studies conducted on kombucha revealed that it has desired bioactivities such as antimicrobial, antioxidant, hepatoprotective, anti-hypercholestorelomic, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, etc. Only a few clinical studies have been also reported. In the current review, we aimed to overhaul pre-clinical bioactivities reported on kombucha as well as its brief compositional chemistry. The literature data indicate that kombucha has valuable biological effects on human health.}, journal={Food Chemistry: X}, author={Abaci, Nurten and Senol Deniz, Fatma Sezer and Orhan, Ilkay Erdogan}, year={2022}, month={Jun}, pages={100302}, language={en} }

Overall, 127 phenolic compounds (70.2% flavonoids, 18.3% phenolic acids, 8.4% other polyphenols, 2.3% lignans and 0.8% stilbenes) were identified, with 103 phenolic compounds reported for the first time in kombuchas. A greater diversity and abundance of phenolic compounds was detected in black tea kombucha, which resulted in a higher antioxidant capacity. However, the green tea kombucha was the only one that presented antibacterial activity against all the bacteria tested and an increased antiproliferative activity against the cancer cell lines, which was attributed to the presence of catechins among the most abundant phenolic compounds and verbascoside as an exclusive compound. Thus, the type of tea used in the kombucha production interferes in its bioactive composition and properties.}, journal={Food Research International (Ottawa, Ont.)}, author={Cardoso, Rodrigo Rezende and Neto, Rafaela Oliveira and Dos Santos D’Almeida, Carolina Thomaz and do Nascimento, Talita Pimenta and Pressete, Carolina Girotto and Azevedo, Luciana and Martino, Hercia Stampini Duarte and Cameron, Luiz Claudio and Ferreira, Mariana Simões Larraz and Barros, Frederico Augusto Ribeiro de}, year={2020}, month={Feb}, pages={108782}, language={eng} }

In addition to the advantage of being a low-sugar probiotic-rich drink, kombucha also offers the benefits of the tea used for its preparation, especially its high antioxidant content. In this research, kombucha tea was prepared by using three different tea types: green, black, and pu’er tea, and the chemical profiles and antioxidant activity were analyzed during the fermentation process (up to 20 days). The results showed that the tea type has an obvious influence on the factors associated with the antioxidant potential. The fermentation process caused a marked increase in polyphenol content and antioxidant activity initially, but this slowed progressively over time. In contrast, the fermentation of black tea contributed to the degradation of flavonoids but showed no significant effect on the other tea types. Therefore, we conclude that the tea type selected to make kombucha affects the end product as well as the fermentation time.}, journal={Journal of Food Quality}, author={Hsieh, Yi and Chiu, Ming-Chung and Chou, Jui-Yu}, editor={Aguayo, Encarna}, year={2021}, month={Nov}, pages={1–9}, language={en} }

Kombucha is characterised by rich chemical content and healthy properties. It includes organic acids, minerals and vitamins originating mainly from tea, amino acids, and biologically active compounds—polyphenols in particular. Kombucha is prepared mainly in the form of black tea, but other tea types are increasingly often used as well, which can significantly impact its content and health benefits. This work shows that the type of tea has a significant influence on the parameters associated with the antioxidant potential, pH, as well as the content of acetic acid, alcohol or sugar. Red tea and green tea on the 1st and 14th day of fermentation are a particularly prominent source of antioxidants, especially polyphenols, including flavonoids.

This popularity is likely driven by its touted health benefits, coupled with the recent scientific movement investigating the role of the microbiome on human health. The purpose of this systematic review is to describe the literature related to empirical health benefits of kombucha as identified from human subjects research. Methods; In July 2018, we searched the term “kombucha” for all document types in the following databases across all available years: PubMed, Scopus, and Ovid. To identify federal research grants related to kombucha, we searched the National Institutes of Health Research Portfolio Online Reporting Tools. Finally, to identify ongoing human subjects research, we searched clinicaltrials.gov and clinicaltrialsregister.eu. We reviewed a total of 310 articles. Results; We found one study reporting the results of empirical research on kombucha in human subjects. We found no results for kombucha in Research Portfolio Online Reporting Tools, clinicaltrials.gov, or clinicaltrialsregister.eu. Conclusions; The nonhuman subjects literature claims numerous health benefits of kombucha; it is critical that these assertions are tested in human clinical trials.

  title={Green Tea Catechins and Cardiovascular Health: An Update}, volume={15}, ISSN={0929-8673}, abstractNote={Epidemiological, clinical and experimental studies have established a positive correlation between green tea consumption and cardiovascular health. Catechins, the major polyphenolic compounds in green tea, exert vascular protective effects through multiple mechanisms, including antioxidative, anti-hypertensive, anti-inflammatory, anti-proliferative, anti-thrombogenic, and lipid lowering effects. (1) Tea catechins present antioxidant activity by scavenging free radicals, chelating redox active transition-metal ions, inhibiting redox active transcription factors, inhibiting pro-oxidant enzymes and inducing antioxidant enzymes. (2) Tea catechins inhibit the key enzymes involved in lipid biosynthesis and reduce intestinal lipid absorption, thereby improving blood lipid profile. (3) Catechins regulate vascular tone by activating endothelial nitric oxide. (4) Catechins prevent vascular inflammation that plays a critical role in the progression of atherosclerotic lesions. The anti-inflammatory activities of catechins may be due to their suppression of leukocyte adhesion to endothelium and subsequent transmigration through inhibition of transcriptional factor NF-kB-mediated production of cytokines and adhesion molecules both in endothelial cells and inflammatory cells. (5) Catechins inhibit proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells by interfering with vascular cell growth factors involved in atherogenesis. (6) Catechins suppress platelet adhesion, thereby inhibiting thrombogenesis. Taken together, catechins may be novel plant-derived small molecules for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases. This review highlights current developments in green tea extracts and vascular health, focusing specifically on the role of tea catechins in the prevention of various vascular diseases and the underlying mechanisms for these actions. In addition, the possible structure-activity relationship of catechins is discussed.}, number={18}, journal={Current medicinal chemistry}, author={Velayutham, Pon and Babu, Anandh and Liu, Dongmin}, year={2008}, pages={1840–1850} }

For example, it has been shown to promote fat oxidation in humans at rest and to prevent obesity and improve insulin sensitivity in mice. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the effects of acute ingestion of green tea extract (GTE) on glucose tolerance and fat oxidation during moderate-intensity exercise in humans. DESIGN: Two studies were performed, both with a counter-balanced crossover design. In study A, 12 healthy men performed a 30-min cycling exercise at 60% of maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max) before and after supplementation. In study B, 11 healthy men took an oral-glucose-tolerance test before and after supplementation. In the 24-h period before the experimental trials, participants ingested 3 capsules containing either GTE (total: 890 +/- 13 mg polyphenols and 366 +/- 5 mg EGCG) or a corn-flour placebo (total: 1729 +/- 22 mg). RESULTS: Average fat oxidation rates were 17% higher after ingestion of GTE than after ingestion of placebo (0.41 +/- 0.03 and 0.35 +/- 0.03 g/min, respectively; P < 0.05). Moreover, the contribution of fat oxidation to total energy expenditure was also significantly higher, by a similar percentage, after GTE supplementation. The insulin area under the curve decreased in both the GTE and placebo trials (3612 +/- 301 and 4280 +/- 309 microIU/dL . 120 min, respectively; P < 0.01), and there was a concomitant increase of 13% in insulin sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: Acute GTE ingestion can increase fat oxidation during moderate-intensity exercise and can improve insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance in healthy young men.}, number={3}, journal={The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition}, author={Venables, Michelle C. and Hulston, Carl J. and Cox, Hannah R. and Jeukendrup, Asker E.}, year={2008}, month={Mar}, pages={778–784}, language={eng} }
