Overall, 127 phenolic compounds (70.2% flavonoids, 18.3% phenolic acids, 8.4% other polyphenols, 2.3% lignans and 0.8% stilbenes) were identified, with 103 phenolic compounds reported for the first time in kombuchas. A greater diversity and abundance of phenolic compounds was detected in black tea kombucha, which resulted in a higher antioxidant capacity. However, the green tea kombucha was the only one that presented antibacterial activity against all the bacteria tested and an increased antiproliferative activity against the cancer cell lines, which was attributed to the presence of catechins among the most abundant phenolic compounds and verbascoside as an exclusive compound. Thus, the type of tea used in the kombucha production interferes in its bioactive composition and properties.}, journal={Food Research International (Ottawa, Ont.)}, author={Cardoso, Rodrigo Rezende and Neto, Rafaela Oliveira and Dos Santos D’Almeida, Carolina Thomaz and do Nascimento, Talita Pimenta and Pressete, Carolina Girotto and Azevedo, Luciana and Martino, Hercia Stampini Duarte and Cameron, Luiz Claudio and Ferreira, Mariana Simões Larraz and Barros, Frederico Augusto Ribeiro de}, year={2020}, month={Feb}, pages={108782}, language={eng} }

Many of these beneficial effects of green tea are related to its catechin, particularly (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate, content. There is evidence from in vitro and animal studies on the underlying mechanisms of green tea catechins and their biological actions. There are also human studies on using green tea catechins to treat metabolic syndrome, such as obesity, type II diabetes, and cardiovascular risk factors., Long-term consumption of tea catechins could be beneficial against high-fat diet-induced obesity and type II diabetes and could reduce the risk of coronary disease. Further research that conforms to international standards should be performed to monitor the pharmacological and clinical effects of green tea and to elucidate its mechanisms of action.}, journal={Chinese Medicine}, author={Chacko, Sabu M and Thambi, Priya T and Kuttan, Ramadasan and Nishigaki, Ikuo}, year={2010}, month={Apr}, pages={13} }

In addition to the advantage of being a low-sugar probiotic-rich drink, kombucha also offers the benefits of the tea used for its preparation, especially its high antioxidant content. In this research, kombucha tea was prepared by using three different tea types: green, black, and pu’er tea, and the chemical profiles and antioxidant activity were analyzed during the fermentation process (up to 20 days). The results showed that the tea type has an obvious influence on the factors associated with the antioxidant potential. The fermentation process caused a marked increase in polyphenol content and antioxidant activity initially, but this slowed progressively over time. In contrast, the fermentation of black tea contributed to the degradation of flavonoids but showed no significant effect on the other tea types. Therefore, we conclude that the tea type selected to make kombucha affects the end product as well as the fermentation time.}, journal={Journal of Food Quality}, author={Hsieh, Yi and Chiu, Ming-Chung and Chou, Jui-Yu}, editor={Aguayo, Encarna}, year={2021}, month={Nov}, pages={1–9}, language={en} }

 title={Chemical Profile and Antioxidant Activity of the Kombucha Beverage Derived from White, Green, Black and Red Tea}, volume={9}, ISSN={2076-3921}, DOI={10.3390/antiox9050447}, abstractNote={Kombucha is a fermented tea beverage prepared as a result of the symbiotic nature of bacterial cultures and yeast, the so-called SCOBY (Symbiotic Cultures of Bacteria and Yeasts). Kombucha is characterised by rich chemical content and healthy properties. It includes organic acids, minerals and vitamins originating mainly from tea, amino acids, and biologically active compounds—polyphenols in particular. Kombucha is prepared mainly in the form of black tea, but other tea types are increasingly often used as well, which can significantly impact its content and health benefits. This work shows that the type of tea has a significant influence on the parameters associated with the antioxidant potential, pH, as well as the content of acetic acid, alcohol or sugar. Red tea and green tea on the 1st and 14th day of fermentation are a particularly prominent source of antioxidants, especially polyphenols, including flavonoids. Therefore, the choice of other tea types than the traditionally used black tea and the subjection of these tea types to fermentation seems to be beneficial in terms of the healthy properties of kombucha.}, number={5}, journal={Antioxidants}, author={Jakubczyk, Karolina and Kałduńska, Justyna and Kochman, Joanna and Janda, Katarzyna}, year={2020}, month={May}, pages={447}, language={en} }

  title={Green Tea Catechins and Cardiovascular Health: An Update}, volume={15}, ISSN={0929-8673}, abstractNote={Epidemiological, clinical and experimental studies have established a positive correlation between green tea consumption and cardiovascular health. Catechins, the major polyphenolic compounds in green tea, exert vascular protective effects through multiple mechanisms, including antioxidative, anti-hypertensive, anti-inflammatory, anti-proliferative, anti-thrombogenic, and lipid lowering effects. (1) Tea catechins present antioxidant activity by scavenging free radicals, chelating redox active transition-metal ions, inhibiting redox active transcription factors, inhibiting pro-oxidant enzymes and inducing antioxidant enzymes. (2) Tea catechins inhibit the key enzymes involved in lipid biosynthesis and reduce intestinal lipid absorption, thereby improving blood lipid profile. (3) Catechins regulate vascular tone by activating endothelial nitric oxide. (4) Catechins prevent vascular inflammation that plays a critical role in the progression of atherosclerotic lesions. The anti-inflammatory activities of catechins may be due to their suppression of leukocyte adhesion to endothelium and subsequent transmigration through inhibition of transcriptional factor NF-kB-mediated production of cytokines and adhesion molecules both in endothelial cells and inflammatory cells. (5) Catechins inhibit proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells by interfering with vascular cell growth factors involved in atherogenesis. (6) Catechins suppress platelet adhesion, thereby inhibiting thrombogenesis. Taken together, catechins may be novel plant-derived small molecules for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases. This review highlights current developments in green tea extracts and vascular health, focusing specifically on the role of tea catechins in the prevention of various vascular diseases and the underlying mechanisms for these actions. In addition, the possible structure-activity relationship of catechins is discussed.}, number={18}, journal={Current medicinal chemistry}, author={Velayutham, Pon and Babu, Anandh and Liu, Dongmin}, year={2008}, pages={1840–1850} }

 title={Green tea extract ingestion, fat oxidation, and glucose tolerance in healthy humans}, volume={87}, ISSN={1938-3207}, DOI={10.1093/ajcn/87.3.778}, abstractNote={BACKGROUND: Green tea consumption is reportedly associated with various health-promoting properties. For example, it has been shown to promote fat oxidation in humans at rest and to prevent obesity and improve insulin sensitivity in mice. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the effects of acute ingestion of green tea extract (GTE) on glucose tolerance and fat oxidation during moderate-intensity exercise in humans. DESIGN: Two studies were performed, both with a counter-balanced crossover design. In study A, 12 healthy men performed a 30-min cycling exercise at 60% of maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max) before and after supplementation. In study B, 11 healthy men took an oral-glucose-tolerance test before and after supplementation. In the 24-h period before the experimental trials, participants ingested 3 capsules containing either GTE (total: 890 +/- 13 mg polyphenols and 366 +/- 5 mg EGCG) or a corn-flour placebo (total: 1729 +/- 22 mg). RESULTS: Average fat oxidation rates were 17% higher after ingestion of GTE than after ingestion of placebo (0.41 +/- 0.03 and 0.35 +/- 0.03 g/min, respectively; P < 0.05). Moreover, the contribution of fat oxidation to total energy expenditure was also significantly higher, by a similar percentage, after GTE supplementation. The insulin area under the curve decreased in both the GTE and placebo trials (3612 +/- 301 and 4280 +/- 309 microIU/dL . 120 min, respectively; P < 0.01), and there was a concomitant increase of 13% in insulin sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: Acute GTE ingestion can increase fat oxidation during moderate-intensity exercise and can improve insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance in healthy young men.}, number={3}, journal={The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition}, author={Venables, Michelle C. and Hulston, Carl J. and Cox, Hannah R. and Jeukendrup, Asker E.}, year={2008}, month={Mar}, pages={778–784}, language={eng} }

Kombucha is conventionally prepared by fermentation of a sugared black tea infusion without tea residue. In this study, the effects of black tea residue and green tea residue on kombucha were studied, and its antioxidant activities, total phenolic contents, as well as concentrations of polyphenols at different fermentation stages were evaluated using ferric-reducing antioxidant power, Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity, Folin-Ciocalteu method and high-performance liquid chromatography with a photodiode array detector. The results showed that fermentation with tea residue could markedly increase antioxidant activities (maximum 3.25 times) as well as polyphenolic concentrations (5.68 times) of kombucha. In addition, green tea residue showed a stronger effect than black tea residue. Overall, it is interesting to find that fermentation with tea residues could be a better strategy to produce polyphenol-rich kombucha beverages.}, number={11}, journal={Antioxidants}, publisher={Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute}, author={Zhou, Dan-Dan and Saimaiti, Adila and Luo, Min and Huang, Si-Yu and Xiong, Ruo-Gu and Shang, Ao and Gan, Ren-You and Li, Hua-Bin}, year={2022}, month={Jan}, pages={155}, language={en} }
