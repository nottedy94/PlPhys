Green tea, white tea, and black tea each originate from the *Camellia sinensis* plant which is native to the tropical and temperate regions of Asia, Africa, and South America [@Gopa.2016]. Small leaves and leaf buds are unfermented and used to make green tea, while white tea is composed of semi-fermented buds, and black tea is composed of fully fermented old leaves [@NCSU]. Tea is a globally consumed beverage second only to water and the drink is praised for its numerous health benefits. Briefly, tea has anti-carcinogenic, anti-angiogenic, anti-mutagenic, anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial, hypocholesterolemic, potentially anti-diabetic, and shows protection against Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease [@Chac.2010; @Gopa.2016]. These and many other health benefits are mainly attributed to green tea polyphenols, less so to flavonols, gallic acid derivatives, vitamins, minerals, enzymes, among others [@Gopa.2016]. Another health drink rising in popularity is Kombucha - which is a fermented beverage resulting from a symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast (SCOBY) in a sweetened tea solution for about two weeks. The flavor profile shifts from sweet to tart to sour with increased fermentation time, and the total phenolic content (TPC) is at least three times greater versus green or black tea [@Zhou.2022]. Green tea and kombuchas are popular for their numerous health benefits and fermentation with a SCOBY enhances these benefits and is suggested by @Jaku.2020 a diet including kombucha can help support the body's antioxidative response, especially for those exposed to mental and physical stress.

The components of green tea (GT) that gives the drink its health benefits comes from polyphenols, flavanols, and gallic acid derivatives [@Gopa.2016]. Important compounds among the polyphenols includes carbohydrates, alkaloids, minerals, vitamins, enzymes, free amino acids, and catechins. The health benefits are most particularly associated with the catechins which comprise 25% - 35% of green tea dry weight. The two most effective antioxidant compounds are epicatechin gallate (ECG) and epigallocatechingallate (EGCG). EGCG is also the most active and abundant - one cup of GT could have 100-200 mg EGCG. @Gopa.2016 found that EGCG can help prevent dental cavities, inhibition of multiple drug resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and potential inhibition of HIV infection. The antioxidant potential of GT can be increased 3.25x [@Zhou.2022] through fermentation with a symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast (SCOBY). Fermentation is the metabolic breakdown of carbohydrates that produces chemical changes in the organic substances via the action of enzymes associated with the SCOBY [@Noma].
