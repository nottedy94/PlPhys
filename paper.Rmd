# Introduction

Green tea (GT), White tea (WT), and Black tea (BT) each originate from the *Camellia sinensis* plant which is native to the tropical and temperate regions of Asia, Africa, and South America [@Gopa.2016]. Small leaves and leaf buds are unfermented and used to make green tea, while white tea is composed of semi-fermented buds, and black tea is composed of fully fermented old leaves [@NCSU]. Tea is a globally consumed beverage second only to water, and the drink is praised for its numerous health benefits, briefly tea has anti-carcinogenic, anti-angiogenic, anti-mutagenic, anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial, hypocholesterolemic, potentially anti-diabetic, and shows protection against Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease [@Chac.2010; @Gopa.2016]. These and many other health benefits are mainly attributed to GT polyphenols, less so to flavonols, gallic acid derivaties, vitamins, minerals, enzymes, and others [@Gopa.2016].
